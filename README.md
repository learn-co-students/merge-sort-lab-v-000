### Merge Sort Lab

In this lab we will ask you to implement merge sort.  We will break this into steps.

1. Implement a function that first finds and removes the smallest element in a sorted array.
2. Implement the merge function to combine two sorted arrays into one larger array.
3. Implement the mergeSort algorithm using the previous functions that you wrote. 

You got this.
